ContextMenuScrollingText 
========================================

Based on the Scrolling Text app that demonstrates ScrollView with a
TextView, this version demonstrates a context menu that appears when
the user performs a long click on the TextView.

Introduction
------------

The app shows how to use a ScrollView to display text. The user can
scroll vertically to read by swiping up and down. If the user performs
a long click on the TextView, the context menu appears with three
options: Edit, Share, and Delete. When the user taps a menu item, the
app displays a Toast message showing which menu option was chosen.
